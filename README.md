# A 7-Day-Incidence based Corona Dashboard

Data on daily infections or total infections can be found at many places over 
the internet. However, these measures have many practical downsides. 

An alternative and more sophisticated measure is the 7-day-incidence, which 
computes as the sum of all infections in the last seven days per 100k 
population.

This dashboard focusses on this statistic and presents data from the RKI and 
WHO.
